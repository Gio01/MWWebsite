            <h1> Rock 'n Roll</h1>
          <hr>
          <p>Rock and roll (often written as rock & roll or rock 'n' roll) is a genre of popular music that originated
            and evolved in the United States during the late 1940s and early 1950s from musical styles such as gospel,
            jump blues, jazz, boogie woogie, and rhythm and blues, along with country music.</p>

          <h1>Origins</h1>
          <hr>
          <p>The origins of rock and roll have been fiercely debated by commentators and historians of music.
            There is general agreement that it arose in the Southern United States – a region that would produce most of
            the major early rock and roll acts – through the meeting of various influences that embodied a merging of the
            African musical tradition with European instrumentation. The migration of many former slaves and their descendants
            to major urban centers such as St. Louis, Memphis, New York City, Detroit, Chicago, Cleveland, and Buffalo. Radio stations that made white and black forms of music available to both groups,
            the development and spread of the gramophone record, and African-American musical styles such as jazz and swing
            which were taken up by white musicians, aided this process of "cultural collision".</p>
          <p>The immediate roots of rock and roll lay in the rhythm and blues, then called "race music",
             and country music of the 1940s and 1950s.[20] Particularly significant influences were jazz, blues,
             gospel, country, and folk. Commentators differ in their views of which of these forms were most
             important and the degree to which the new music was a re-branding of African-American rhythm and blues
             for a white market, or a new hybrid of black and white forms.</p>
